# CHAMPIONS LEAGUE API âš½

## Description
Project developed in [Digital Innovation One - DIO](https://web.dio.me)'s NodeJs Fundamentals course.

The project's objective was to implement a robust architecture and work with different http methods to get and send data (players and clubs) from/to the API.

## Request Endpoints

### Listing all clubs:
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/clubs`
- **Description:** Returns a list of all clubs data.

### Filtering club by id:
- **Endpoint:** `GET /clubs/:id`
- **Description:** Returns data of the club that owns the id requested.

### Listing all players:
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/players`
- **Description:** Returns a list of all players data.

### Filtering players by id:
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/players/:id`
- **Description:** Return the player who owns the requested id.

### Add new player:
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/players`
- **Description:** Receives a player in the request body and adds it to the players list.

### Delete player by id:
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/players/:id`
- **Description:** Deletes the player with the id requested from the players list.

### Update player:
- **Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/players`
- **Description:** Receives a player from the request body and adds it to the players list replacing the player with the same id.

## API response data format:

**Clubs:**
```js
[
    {
        id:number,
        name:string
    }
]
```
**Players:**
````js
[
    {
        id: number,
        name: string,
        club: string,
        nationality: string,
        position: string,
        statistics: NormalStatisticsModel | GoalkeeperStatisticsModel
    }
]
````
**As we can see, there are different statistics for players and for goalkeepers:**

**Players:**
````js
{
    Overall: number,
    Pace: number,
    Shooting: number,
    Passing: number,
    Dribbling: number,
    Defending: number,
    Physical: number
}
````
**Goalkeepers:**
````js
{
    Overall: number,
    Diving:number,
    Handling: number,
    Kicking: number,
    Reflexes: number,
    Speed: number,
    Positioning: number,
}
````

## Differences between my project and the course's:
- There aren't important differences, the only difference is related to the PATCH method. In the course it was only possible to update the player's statiscs and the way I did it it's possible to change any of its attributes.
